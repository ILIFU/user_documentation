Ilifu User Documentation
========================

Welcome to the Ilifu user documentation repository.

All the information that a user may need in order
to use the Ilifu systems and services should be made
available here over time.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the documentation, follow the steps below:
1. Fork/clone the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Navigate to the `docs` directory
4. If you want to make a new category, create a directory with it's name, otherwise create a new file such as `<topic_name_here>.md` under the directory which is most appropriate for it.
    - You can fill this `.md` page with the content of the documentation you want to write.
5. Edit the `_sidebar.md` file and add a relative link to your new document, assuming that the `docs` folder is the root.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
6. Submit your changes back to github and create a pull request from your branch to master for review by the site administrators.

To view the rendered site locally while you are making changes:
```
docsify serve ilifu_user_docs/docs
```
By default this serves the pages to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

<b id="f1">1</b>: The content of `_sidebar.md` should look similar to this (replace everything in and including <\>): [â†©](#a1)
```markdown
- **<Category_title>**
    - [<Name_for_documentation_page_you_wrote>](<location_of_.md>)
    ... 
```
Refer to `_sidebar.md` in `docs` for examples.
