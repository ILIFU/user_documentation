# Contact and Communication

If you need to get hold of any one of the developers or administrators at Ilifu please contact us through the following channels.

## Email support Tickets

The primary method of support is via email to [support@ilifu.ac.za](mailto:support@ilifu.ac.za) . This goes into a ticket
system which the technical staff will respond to.

## Slack

Slack is a platform that connects teams with the apps, services, and resources they need to get work done. For Ilifu, the slack channel is used for informal help (not official support).

Please contact the official support channel by emailing [support@ilifu.ac.za](mailto:support@ilifu.ac.za) and ask to be added to the informal Slack channel.
