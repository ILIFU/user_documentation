# Submitting jobs to be run on the Ilifu cluster

There are several methods to run jobs on Ilifu.

1. Users may get access to a Jupyter Lab spawner mechanism on the cluster. This provides a Jupyter lab environment where users select what size compute node they need to run. This is a good environment for users to experiment with code and visualise certain results. This environment will be made available at [jupyter.ilifu.ac.za](https://jupyter.ilifu.ac.za)

2. Users can login to the SLURM headnode at and submit tasks to the SLURM queue. This environment will be made available at [batch.ilifu.ac.za](https://batch.ilifu.ac.za).

3. Selected users will be given access to the OpenStack dashboard in order to have full control over the setup of a computing environment. This is available at [dashboard.ilifu.ac.za](https://dashboard.ilifu.ac.za)
