# Directory structure

The following describes the directory structure as related to the ilifu data policies.

Users' home directories are located in `/users/`. This directory is for users' scripts. No large files should be stored in `/users/`. It is recommended that users make use of a repository such as Github to backup scripts and files.

`/scratch/` is the primary directory for data processing. `/scratch/` is for **short-term** storage only. Only temporary data required for processing should be copied here. After processing, data products should be moved to the relevant project or group directory, and intermediate data products should be removed **immediately**.

`/scratch/users/<username>` is a users' specific directory for data processing.

`/scratch/projects/<project_name>` is for data processing related to a project where multiple users will be involved in the data processing. `/scratch/projects/` directories are created on request.

There are a number of groups within the ilifu cloud computing community, including IDIA, CBIO and SANBI among others. For **medium- and long-term storage**, the directory structure has been broken down by group.

### IDIA directory structure

**NOTE: we're in the process of moving to the following directory structure. During this process some directories will still exist at /data/. We will contact project groups directly as project folders are moved to the new directory structure.**

* `/idia/` - the base directory for all IDIA related projects.

* `/idia/users` - user's directory for storing long-term data and data products that are not project specific.

* `/idia/projects/` - project specific directories. These directories are for sharing data and resources within project groups. Project archive data, data products, intermediate data and project specific resources, such as script or software containers, are stored here. Raw data associated with a project will also be available from the project folder. Raw data folders should always be read-only.

* `/idia/raw/` - raw data (read-only data) is stored here. Raw data, from SARAO is moved into access controlled project directories within `/idia/raw/`. This data is retrievable from SARAO and therefore will not be included in backup procedures. Symbolic links to the raw data will be accessible from the project directory.

* `/idia/software/` - [software containers](https://docs.ilifu.ac.za/#/tech_docs/software_environments?id=singularity-containers) and the [IDIA Pipelines](https://idia-pipelines.github.io/) software is stored here.

* `/idia/data/public` - public data and data products available to all users are stored here.

### CBIO directory structure

User homes are in `/users/`. This is not currently backed up

CBIO users will be using the CephFS parallel file partition â€” our space is in `/cbio/`. Directories that have been setup:
* `/cbio/users` - a user's private scratch space. Limited to 5TB. Working in a project space allows storage space to be used more efficiently. Please see the [Data Management Form](/bioinformatics/cbio#data-management-plan-for-projects) in regard to data management plan for projects. 
* `/cbio/projects` - project specific directories. These directories are for sharing data and resources within project groups. Project archive data, data products, intermediate data and project specific resources, such as scripts , are stored here. 
* `/cbio/dbs` - general-purpose annotation and reference databases are stored here. Most `dbs` will be open but some may be accessed controlled e.g in `/cbio/dbs/refpanels/`.
* `/cbio/datasets` - Access controlled datasets are stored here e.g. SAHGP, Baylor, AGVP.
* `/cbio/soft` - Software that is needed to run workflows is installed here; most of our other software will be encapsulated into singularity images.
* `/cbio/images` - shared singularity images are stored here.
