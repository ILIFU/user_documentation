# MeerKAT processing

Many Ilifu users process MeerKAT data as part of the data-intensive research in astronomy supported on the ilifu Cloud Computing Research Facility. This includes [MeerKAT Large Survey Projects (LSPs)](http://public.ska.ac.za/meerkat/meerkat-large-survey-projects) and [Open Time Projects (OTPs)](https://skaafrica.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/topic/bc9d6ad2-8321-4e13-a97a-d19d6d019a1c/article/349339747). As part of our support of MeerKAT projects, we have developed policies and documentation outlining processing and storage strategies for MeerKAT projects.

With these policies, guidelines and strategies, we aim to ensure the successful support of the diverse research groups on the Ilifu facility. These policies and guidelines are not intended to hamper research efforts. However, the environment in which we conduct our research is shared and resource-limited, and therefore practices that make efficient use of those resources will further our ability to successfully support the diverse research teams on Ilifu.

## Ilifu Processing and Storage for MeerKAT projects

The Ilifu Processing and Storage for MeerKAT projects document outlines a processing and storage strategy in support of any MeerKAT imaging projects. We use experience running the [IDIA calibration and imaging pipeline](https://idia-pipelines.github.io/docs/processMeerKAT) for MeerKAT 32k data sets to undertake a quantitative assessment of requirements and data policies for successful processing of MeerKAT observations, from raw data to science data products. This strategy informs the data management plans and resource estimates for MeerKAT projects. The document is intended as background information for MeerKAT project members developing data processing plans on Ilifu.

## Ilifu MeerKAT Open Time Project Policies

The Ilifu MeerKAT Open Time Project policies document outlines the agreement between Ilifu and the Ilifu Open Time Project member.

## Ilifu MeerKAT Open Time Project Guidelines

The Ilifu MeerKAT Open Time Project Guidelines summarise the strategy presented in the <a href="/astronomy/Ilifu_Processing_and_Storage_for_MeerKAT_projects.pdf">Ilifu Processing and Storage for MeerKAT projects</a> document, and is intended to provide guidelines for processing and data management for the Ilifu MeerKAT OTPs, but includes principles generally applicable to any MeerKAT project.
