# Requesting Time

Ilifu may be accessed by the partner institutions. Time on the cluster is allocated via
the Computing Resouce Allocation Committee which makes recommendations to the Facility Director.

At present the facility is in a phase of Early User Testing in which the formal time allocation process is not being implemented, but certain invited early users are being allowed limited access.

A webform will be made available in Q4 2018 in order to accommodate new requests for access to the Ilifu with the link posted here. In the meantime, queries about access can be directed to [support@ilifu.ac.za](mailto:support@ilifu.ac.za).
