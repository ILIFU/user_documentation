# Requesting Time

Ilifu may be accessed by faculty and researchers from the partner institutions. Time on the cluster is allocated via
the Computing Resouce Allocation Committee which makes recommendations to the Facility Director.

At present the facility is in a phase of Early User Testing where limited access is being granted to a pool of shared risk users.

The webform for requesting access to the facility is [available here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHtL7R_S2HHIecFeZn8sicABdvFO7NZC1TRJdU2S5GSL4zYQ/viewform)
