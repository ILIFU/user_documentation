# SSH Keys

Access to ilifu is controlled through ssh public-private key pairs.

If you are a new user you have likely just generated a ssh key pair, and sent your public key to our system through the webform.

In the event that you lose your ssh key pair, you can generate a new key pair by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/). If you have lost your ssh key pair you will receive an error `Permission denied (publickey)` when trying to access the ilifu system via ssh. In this event, please generate a new ssh key pair and contact support@ilifu.ac.za, providing your new public key. **Do not send your private key.**
